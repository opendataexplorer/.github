# Welcome to the [Open Data Explorer](https://opendata-explorer.web.app/). 

The Open Data Explorer is a friendly and intuitive web app for discovering and visualizing open data. By bringing together open data from a variety of sources into one platform, open data users can quickly find datasets and create useful insights. 

Here is the project [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opendataexplorer/projects/1).

We're always looking for feedback, so feel free to be our QA and open an issue where things have went wrong!
